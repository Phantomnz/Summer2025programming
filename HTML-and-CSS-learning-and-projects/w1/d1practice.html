<!-- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating webpages. It structures content using elements.
paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag, headings with <h1> to <h6> tags, where <h1> is the largest and <h6> is the smallest.

The <head> tag contains metadata like the title and the main content of the webpage and links to css.

The <title> tag sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab.

The <html> tag is the root element of an HTML page, and it contains all other elements.

most tags have an opening and a closing tag, like <p> and </p>, but some tags are self-closing, like <img />.

<body> contains the content of the webpage that is visible to users
