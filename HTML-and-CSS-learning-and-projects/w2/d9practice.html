<!-- HTML – Day 9

1. Document Type Declaration
    The <!DOCTYPE html> at the top triggers standards mode in browsers.

2. Character Entities

    Use entities for reserved characters:
    &lt;  <!-- < -->
    &gt;  <!-- > -->
    &amp; <!-- & -->
<!--   
3. Block vs. Inline Elements
    - Block-level (e.g. `<div>`, `<p>`) start on a new line and stretch full width.
    - Inline (e.g. `<span>`, `<a>`) flow within text.
4. Semantic HTML

    Use meaningful tags for structure and accessibility:
    <article>, <section>, <aside>, <nav>

5. HTML Comments in Templates

    When using server-side templates, avoid leaking comments: -->

    <!-- This will not appear in rendered HTML -->
    <!--<%-- This server-side comment won’t be sent to client --%>-->
